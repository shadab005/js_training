      /*
       * Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements
       * with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.
       * A component has:
       * •	Its own JavaScript class.
       * •	DOM structure managed solely by its class, outside code doesn’t access it (“encapsulation” principle).
       * •	CSS styles applied to the component.
       * •	API: events, class methods etc, to interact with other components.
       *
       * JavaScript provides
       * •	Custom elements – to define custom HTML elements.  Note : Custom element name must have a hyphen
       *        Two Types :
       *             1.	Autonomous custom elements – “all-new” elements, extending the abstract HTMLElement class.
       *             2.  Customized built-in elements – extending built-in elements, like a customized button, based on HTMLButtonElement etc.
       * •	Shadow DOM – to create an internal DOM for the component, hidden from the others.
       * •	CSS Scoping – to declare styles that only apply inside the Shadow DOM of the component.
       * •	Event retargeting and other minor stuff to make custom components better fit the development.
       *

      //********************************** Example 1 ************************************
      //We can extend and customize built-in HTML elements by inheriting from their classes.
      //ex :  class HelloButton extends HTMLButtonElement { /* custom element methods */ }
      class HelloAutonomous extends HTMLElement {
        // browser calls this method when the element is added to the document
        connectedCallback() {
          this.textContent = "Hello World";
        }
        // browser calls this method when the element is removed from the document
        disconnectedCallback() {}
        //return [/* array of attribute names to monitor for changes */];
        static get observedAttributes() {}
        // called when one of attributes listed above is modified
        attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {}
        // there can be other element methods and properties
        //Note : When definfing we need not write all the methods. In this case just writing the connectedCallback() would have sufficed.
      }
      // customElements.define('hello-button', HelloButton, {extends: 'button'}); if we extend HTMLButtonElement
      customElements.define("hello-world", HelloAutonomous);

      //********************************** Example 2 ************************************
      class HelloButton extends HTMLButtonElement {
        constructor() {
          super();
          this.addEventListener("click", () => alert("Hello!"));
        }
      }
      customElements.define('hello-button', HelloButton, { extends: 'button' });
